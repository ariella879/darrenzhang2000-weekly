### [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started) Response
1. I learned that Wikipedia has a set of guidelines known as "5 pillars", which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars).
  * The guidelines are as follows:
    1. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
    2. Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
      * I find that it could be difficult to write from a neutral point of view at times, since we're all subjected to biases. 
      * I find it hard to believe that none of the 6 million articles on wikipedia contain some bias.
    3. Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
    4. Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
      * This is similar to a code of conduct. 
    5. Wikipedia has no firm rules
 2. I learned that every article has a talk page, which is super useful when there are conflicts among editors.    
 3. Wikipedia has a [markup page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) which is useful for editing.
 4. Wikipedia also has a [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor) which is also useful.
