### [Contributing to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia#Getting_started) Response
1. I learned that Wikipedia has a set of guidelines known as "5 pillars", which can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars).
  * The guidelines are as follows:
    1. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia
    2. Wikipedia is written from a neutral point of view
      * I find that it could be difficult to write from a neutral point of view at times, since we're all subjected to biases. 
      * I find it hard to believe that none of the 6 million articles on wikipedia contain some bias.
    3. Wikipedia is free content that anyone can use, edit, and distribute
    4. Wikipedia's editors should treat each other with respect and civility
      * This is similar to a code of conduct. 
    5. Wikipedia has no firm rules
 2. I learned that every article has a talk page, which is super useful when there are conflicts among editors.    
 3. Wikipedia has a [markup page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) which is useful for editing.
 4. Wikipedia also has a [visual editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:VisualEditor) which is also useful.

 ### Project updates:
1. October 31, 2019: I am writing a README for the [components directory](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/tree/master/myapp/client/src) of the client part of myapp. [Here.](https://github.com/darrenzhang2000/OpenSource-NY/blob/master/myapp/client/src/Components/README.md)
2. November 1, 2019: I began by understanding [Header.js](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/blob/master/myapp/client/src/Components/Header.js). Once I understood what it does, I gave a description of every feature in the header file, which I added and commited to my fork. Here is an image of what I commited:

3. November 3, 2019: I watched a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AbaV3nrw6E&list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBuKtLgPR_zWYnrwv-JllpA) on React and read its [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) to gain a better understanding of REACT.
4. November 3, 2019: After I read and understood [RankElement.js](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/blob/master/myapp/client/src/Components/RankElement.js), I included a description of what it does in my README. I'm a bit unsure of how scoring works so I wrote a placeholder text to remind myself to investigate this further once I understand more of this project. Here is an image of what I've included in my second major commit:
