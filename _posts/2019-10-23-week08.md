### Summary of Course Related Activities:
In class this week, I was deciding between Python MatPlotLib and Python Pandas. 
However, when I filtered the issues by the "easy" or "first-time-contribution" tags, all of the issues were either claimed or resolved. 
The other issues I've seen were not geared towards first-time contributers. 
After talking to Andrey (he took Open Source Software Development some time ago) at the Skirball Science Center, 
I've decided that I will contribute to [OpenSource-NY](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY). 
I heard that this project was started at Hunter.
