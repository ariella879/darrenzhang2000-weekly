### Project Activities:
The dependencies for [OpenSource-NY](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY) were easy to install. It only took a few minutes to install all of the necessary files. 
The only commands I needed were the following:
```
sudo apt-get update --yes
sudo apt-get install npm --yes
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

I was able to get the server to run, althought I got the following error message:
```
Proxy error: Could not proxy request /express_backend from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000/.
See https://nodejs.org/api/errors.html#errors_common_system_errors for more information (ECONNREFUSED).

Proxy error: Could not proxy request /express_backend from localhost:3000 to http://localhost:5000/.

```
I am hoping to get this fixed on Monday. 

I've decided that I am going to contribute to the documentation of this project because I am a beginner. This issue can be found [here](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY/issues/85). 

### Comments on Bill Reyer's visit
I found it very interesting to hear about open source projects from a business perspective. He brought up important issues to consider, such as keeping an eye on the types of licenses to use (such as GPL), because the company wouldn't want to be forced to reveal all of their source code, which throws away their advantage in the business market. I also enjoyed hearing about the benefits of open source, such as  competing with closed systems, driving employee engagement, giving back to the community, and transparency for the software installed by the client. 


### Summary of Course Related Activities:
In class this week, I was deciding between Python MatPlotLib and Python Pandas. 
However, when I filtered the issues by the "easy" or "first-time-contribution" tags, all of the issues were either claimed or resolved. 
The other issues I've seen were not geared towards first-time contributers. 
After talking to Andrey (he took Open Source Software Development some time ago) at the Skirball Science Center, 
I've decided that I will contribute to [OpenSource-NY](https://github.com/opensource-ny/OpenSource-NY). 
I heard that this project was started at Hunter.
