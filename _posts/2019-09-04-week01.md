I decided to take a course in open source software development because I am curious about the subject and I want to learn more about it.  
I haven't had any direct experience in open source software development although I did use open source softwares without knowing what it was.

I'm also interested in this class because I want to participate in open course projects.  I want to take a more "hands-on" class to balance out my other lecture-based classes. 

Some examples of open source softwares I've used in the past as the following:
* Linux
* Ubuntu
* PostgreSQL
  * _I took a course on Udemy and learned about PostgreSQL_
* Mozilla's Firefox web browser
* Python Programming Language
* Wikipedia
* Open Street Map 
  * _I've used Open Street Map in high school when I was mapping homes in developing countries as a member of Red Cross_
* Notepad++
  * _This was the first editor I've used. Now I switched to Sublime._
