### Summary of Course Related Activities:
When I was surfing youtube, I came across this video called [I Decorated My Apartment Using AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCvUCjEKNiA&list=LL_TRysrcIHGicGXO6_uOR0Q&index=2&t=0s) by John Fish. I thought this video was really exciting because it introduced Neural Networks to me, which I found to be super fascinating and is something I hope to learn more about. The program that he used happened to be open source. He looked at the program and tweaked it so that he could choose his own photos and have a computer generate new art using those photos. This is a really interesting and inspirational use of open source software. I hope to do something similar in the future, not just on Neural Networks but on all sorts of computer science projects I find to be interesting. 

### Blog edits
* Credits to @Shakil Rafi for teaching me how to update my gitHub fork with his original weekly_posts. 
* I added a url to Shakil Rafi's week 5 blog.
* [Here](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/srafi1-weekly/pulls) is the link to my contribution.




### Read Section 4 of [GitHub's How To Contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)
I read section 4 of _GitHub's How To Contribute_ and came across some other websites that helped me find projects.
* [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
	* This is one website I found to be very helpful because I can just pick a repo and expect to recieve open issues in my inbox. This is a great way to contribute to open source because I know what issues are there that needs solving. 
* [Up-for-grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/filters?names=550)
	* I find this website to be very appealing because it is directly geared towards new contributers. It has very simple instructions telling me how to get involved and easily filter out which projects that I want to work on. 
* [Source Sort](https://www.sourcesort.com/?refinementList%5Blanguages%5D=&page=1&configure%5BhitsPerPage%5D=36)
	* This is another very useful website because I get to choose a specific language and I get filtered results based on that language. I can even choose multiple languages, such as CSS, HTML, and Javascript all at once. 
	* _I think this one is my favorite so far_

### Comments about the git and gitHub stuff I learned this week
* While I understand the general idea of the [workflow activity](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-fall-2019/github-workflow-activity-01), I found it difficult to keep track of every individual steps along the way. This bothers me because if I incorrectly execute any of the steps in a real project, then I will have difficulty figuring out where I went wrong. I did understand basic commands such as git add, git commit and git push much better because I worked with those quite a bit in the past few weeks. I do think that the activities we did in class are useful because those are the basics to every major project.
