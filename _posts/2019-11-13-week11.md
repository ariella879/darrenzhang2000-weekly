### Response to  [open source BIOS coreboot article](https://opensource.com/article/19/11/coreboot-system76-laptops?utm_campaign=intrel)
I believe that having an open source hardware is beneficial in many ways. As mentioned during the talk by Karen Sandler, having open source code means that having more eyes to look for bugs. Because companies can only hire so many people, there cannot account for every possible edge and situations out there. Having an open source hardware means the community will be able to improve the product together. As the article mentioned, this will allow the users to not have to reimplement something that's already accomplished. 

### Kevin Fleming's visit
Unfortunately, I had to miss class (to prepare for Cuny 2x internship speed interviews). I hope to learn as much as I can by reading other students' blog posts about his visit.
